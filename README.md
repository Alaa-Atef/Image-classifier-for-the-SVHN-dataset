# Image-classifier-for-the-SVHN-dataset

In this Capstone Project, I developed feedforward/MLP and convolutional neural network classifier models for the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.

I've built, trained, validated, evaluated and saved my model for the task of classifying real-world images of digits into one of ten classes.
